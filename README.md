## ProfessOrNot

A better rate my professor that uses personality tests and heuristics to recommend classes based on your learning styles and preferences.

### Mission

Different students learn in different ways, and what one student likes in a professor may not apply to everyone. We think this could be improved. Using a personality test and learning style survey, we can create an algorithm to weight scores based on the submitters learning style similarity to the requestor, and provide a personalized recommendation.

### Key Technologies

Frontend: React, Redux, Axios

Backend: Django, Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQLs

### Repository

#### Branches

:lock:`develop` default branch, all approved work merges here [at lease one review required]

:lock:`release` once a release is ready, a PR is made to this branch and everyone needs to approve [everyone must review]

`IS##-Issue_name` create a branch for each issue you are working on so we can keep track of everything

#### Pull Requests

When making a pull request you need to add someone as a reviewer. If your code changes something someone else wrote please add **them** as a reviewer so they can see what has changed. 

When reviewing a PR, check that the person isn't going to break your code or someone elses. If you see something that changes someone elses code, add them as a reviewer and let them know.

*The goal of PRs is to keep someone else from breaking your code by accident!*

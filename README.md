## ProfessOrNot

A better rate my professor that uses personality tests and heuristics to recommend classes based on your learning styles and preferences.

### Mission

Different students learn in different ways, and what one student likes in a professor may not apply to everyone. We think this could be improved. Using a personality test and learning style survey, we can create an algorithm to weight scores based on the submitters learning style similarity to the requestor, and provide a personalized recommendation.
